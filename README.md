# Contrained-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
A keras implementation of the publication "Constrained Convolutional Neural Networks: A New Approach Towards General Purpose Image Manipulation Detection" on IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, volume 13. This code was written by reading the paper, the authors do mention that they released some source code, but I wanted to implement the paper my own, so I haven't looked at their code. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that this code is one hundred percent on par with what they did. But I do think it's pretty close.     

Tested on keras 2.1.2 with Tensorflow 1.4.0 as backend.
